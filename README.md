# Atomic Pizza Box (work in progress)
An IoT device to order a pizza

## Overview
This is a project to create an IoT pizza ordering box. I wanted to use and increase my 3D-printing skills to create an enclosure to house a Raspberry-Pi and electronics components to enable ordering a pizza from a physical box.

There are some well-known restaurants that have RESTful APIs available, and I thought it would be fun to have something to physically hold, and all that would be needed would be to push a giant arcade-style button. Of course the requisite sound effects will be triggered when activating the power switch, and lighting up the big button when the order is ready to submit.

Why? Why not?! :-)
